# üè† local_rcc

*Selfhosted game servers for the latest versions of Roblox.*

**local_rcc** is a library that works with Roblox Studio (currently Windows only)
and allows the Roblox Player to connect to a Roblox Studio hosted server.

## üõ†Ô∏è Building

This guide is for building on Microsoft Windows.

Make sure you have [Microsoft Visual 2022 with the base C++ development pack](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/)
installed.

Clone and `cd` into the repository:
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/rsblox/local_rcc.git
cd local_rcc
```

### With Visual Studio Code & CMake Tools extension

Make sure you have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
installed with the [CMake Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools)
extention installed.

Open the cloned repository:
```powershell
code .
```

If prompted to select a build kit, select the `amd64` one.

Navigate to the CMake tab and set the build type to `RelWithDebInfo`.

In the project outline in the same CMake tab, build the local_rcc
[local_rcc.dll] target. Once completed, the library should be located at
`bin/local_rcc.dll`.

## üìñ Explanation

There are four steps to make a team test compatible with Player:
[setting a fast flag](#debuglocalrccserverconnection),
[blocking an unhandled item](#clientqositem),
[compiling compatible bytecode](#bytecodeencoderclient),
and [replicating the bytecode](#networkschema).

### DebugLocalRccServerConnection

Overriding the fast flag, `DebugLocalRccServerConnection`, on both Player and
Studio will allow a connection to be made between the client and the server.
It also will force the client to connect to `localhost|53640`.

With this alone, you can already join a Studio team test from Player - however,
it is not _playable_ yet.

### ClientQoSItem

<!-- üëÄ -->

Shortly after Player joins the team test server, it will be kicked after
sending a `ClientQoSItem` - which is unhandled by Studio. This can be resolved
by refusing to deserialize the item if a `ClientQoSItem` is passed to
`RBX::Network::Replicator::deserializeItem`.

### BytecodeEncoderClient

Opening the developer console in Player after connecting to the team test
server shows some strange errors with the path of `LocalScript` instances that
are replicated to Player and none of them are executed. This is partly due to
how Studio populates the contents of the server's `legalScripts` vector. A
`LegalScript` is a 'whitelisted' script for replication, containing source and
bytecode. The function `RBX::Network::Server::registerLegalSharedScript` is
used to register _and compile_ these scripts.

Studio already calls this function and even invokes `LuaVM::compile` - however,
on Studio it just returns an empty `std::string`. This can be fixed by hooking
`LuaVM::compile` and compiling source with `LuaVM::BytecodeEncoderClient`.

### NetworkSchema

Even after compiling scripts correctly and populating each `LegalScript` with
bytecode, the same error appears in the developer console. When a server is
started, a `NetworkSchema` is generated, which contains info for every class in
the reflection database. This includes info on how to send properties, like
`Script.Source`, which is determined by their `NetworkValueFormat`. By default,
Studio selects the type for `Script.Source` to be `ProtectedStringSource`, and
sends the source code of scripts to other Studio clients for them to compile
themselves.

This can be fixed by forcing the server to use `ProtectedStringBytecode`, which
will make it get the stored bytecode from the `legalScripts` vector and send it
over when serializing the property. The generation of the `NetworkSchema`
occurs in `RBX::Network::NetworkSchema::generateSchemaDefinitionPacket`, and
the portion of interest is when it chooses the corresponding
`NetworkValueFormat` for the reflection type `ProtectedString`.
